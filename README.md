# MTA-Turnstile-Data
Analysis and Visualizations for NYC MTA Turnstile Data

Used Excel and Python to analyze MTA turnstile data collected during one week in November 2018. Data set was composed of every entrance and every exit at every subway turnstile in every station. I opted to focus on weekday morning commuters and where they entered and exited the subway system. Regrettably, data does not account for specific lines that commuters utilize once inside a station and does not accommodate transferring within stations. Visualizations were initially created with Matplotlib and then improved upon in Adobe Illustrator.
